This README file indtroduces Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) simple examples with BlueZ stack in Linux OS.
The simple examples consist of the followings:
- btscan: inquiring nearby Bluetooth devices and displaying their BDADDR and user-friendly names. 
- rfcomm-server:
	Binding Bluetooth RFCOMM socket to local Bluetooth adapter and waiting for connection from remote. 
	RFCOMM_SERVER_PORT_NUM and RFCOMM_SERVER_BLUETOOTH_ADDR defined in rfcomm_socket.h should be modified in your test environment. 
- rfcomm-client: 
	Connecting to remote Bluetooth server with specified RFCOMM_SERVER_BLUETOOTH_ADDR. Then, send test messages. 
- l2cap-server: 
	Binding Bluetooth L2CAP socket to local Bluetooth adapter and waiting for connection from remote. 
	L2CAP_SERVER_PORT_NUM and L2CAP_SERVER_BLUETOOTH_ADDR defined in rfcomm_socket.h should be modified in your test environment. 
- l2cap-client:
	Connecting to remote Bluetooth server with specified L2CAP_SERVER_BLUETOOTH_ADDR. Then, send test messages. 
- sdp-register: connecting to SDP server in local adapter and registering service classes. The servie id is defined in sdp_test.h.
- sdp-search: connecting to remote SDP server with specified SDP_SERVER_BLUETOOTH_ADDR and searching for RFCOMM_UUID to get the correct port number.
